## [Foreword to the Sixth Anatomical Cabinet (translation from Latin)](https://richardkf.github.io/popularSci/faulkRuysch.pdf)

(Excerpted from *Frederik Ruysch and his* Thesaurus Anatomicus.)

I absolutely loved the challenge of this translation project. Any opportunity to work with Latin is a joy because it allows me to plunge deep into the grammar weeds and immerse myself in stacks of reference books. But, in this case, my work was compounded by the need to become familiar with the controversies (and the vocabularly) of late-17th-century anatomy.

My aim with this translation was to craft something that's approachable for a modern reader while retaining both the original author's voice and the fundamental strangeness of early-modern science writing. (Fellow grammar nerds will notice that I also retained the idiosyncrasies of 17th-century punctuation.)

**Note:** This passage mentions cadavers and human dissection, so think before you click.

## [Magnetic Theory](https://richardkf.github.io/popularSci/faulkMagneticTheory.pdf)

This mini-essay comes from my book *The Next Big Thing*, which considers some of the outstanding inventions and ideas that shaped (or had dashed hopes of shaping) human history.

All but forgotten today, magnetic theory was an early product of experimental science that was widely (if briefly) embraced as confirmation of Copernicus's sun-centered model of the universe.
