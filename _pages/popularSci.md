## [Foreword to the Sixth Anatomical Cabinet (translation from Latin)](https://richardkf.github.io/popularSci/faulkRusych.pdf)
(An excerpt from *Frederik Ruysch and his* Thesaurus Anatomicus.)

I absolutely loved the challenge of this translation project. Any opportunity to work with Latin is a joy because it allows me to plunge deep into the grammar weeds and immerse myself in stacks of reference books. But, in this case, my work was compounded by the need to become familiar with the controversies (and the vocabularly) of late-17th-century anatomy.

My aim with this translation was to craft something that was approachable for a modern reader while retaining both the original author's voice and the fundamental strangeness of early-modern science writing.
