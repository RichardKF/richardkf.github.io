My name is Richard Faulk, and I've been a profesional writer for almost 20 years.

The only thing I love more than learning new thing is explaining my discoveries to others. While my pieces are often funny, I take the craft of writing seriously. Whatever my task, I aim for language that is clean, clear, and perfectly pitched to its audience.

Have a look aroundâ€”I hope you find something you enjoy!
