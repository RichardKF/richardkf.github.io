## [Frederik Ruysch and His *Theaurus Anatomicus*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046039/frederik-ruysch-and-his-ithesaurus-anatomicusi/)

“An indispensible and brilliant translation by Richard Faulk of the *Thesaurus Anatomicus*. It is almost like Ruysch is talking to the reader.”
—Robert Maddox-Harle, *Leonardo* magazine

## [The Next Big Thing](https://www.amazon.com/Next-Big-Thing-Boom-Bust-ebook/dp/B0873CG9WX)

From the first chariot to the latest iPhone, a novelty-hungry public has repeatedly shown its willingness to be seduced by the newest disruptive technology, mind-blowing discovery, or paradigm-shifting insight. But for every Walkman or Platonic dialog, there’s a Segway scooter gathering dust in a forgotten corner of our collective memory. *The Next Big Thing* sifts through 3,000 years of Western culture to highlight history’s most hyped hits and inglorious misses.

## [Gross America](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/308237/gross-america-by-richard-faulk/)

*Gross America* is a coast-to-coast catalog of the most grandly gross science experiments, beautifully bizarre art, and delightfully disgusting historical sites that America has to offer. Part travel atlas, part trivia guide, *Gross America* presents these United States as you've never seen them before—weird, wonderful, strange, and totally, utterly gross.
