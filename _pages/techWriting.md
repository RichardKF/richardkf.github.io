## [Latin Dictionaries](https://latin-dict.github.io)

This website, which collects historical and specialty Latin and Ancient Greek dictionaries, is a labor of love maintained the linguist Nikita Murzintcev. I gave the documentation pages (Docs, Quick Start, and Hunspell) their first thorough revision in three yearsâ€”updating links and technical content, revising how-tos, and revising the language to be more clear and consistent.

I forked the site on GitHub and made edits in Markdown using VS Code. I made the graphics in Snagit.

## [How to create a reusable title sequence in Adobe Premiere Rush](https://richardkf.github.io/techWriting/faulkTitleSequence.pdf)

The genesis of this instructional was a problem I encountered in a tech writing class. We were working with Adobe Premiere Rush, and I wanted to reuse a single title sequence to give my video projects the feel of a documentary series. However, there was no documented function for this, and I couldn't find online cheats either. So I figured it out my own, documented it, and submitted the guide as another assignment.

I made this in Apple Pages and edited the images in Snagit.

## [Developer Guide for MoonBeam](https://richardkf.github.io/techWriting/faulk-moonbeam-guide.pdf)

For this class assignment in API documentation, I was given the marketing material, developer notes, and placeholder code for a hypothetical photo sharing app. My task was to synthesize that information and insert it seamlessly into a template (which was also provided). The Introduction, Use Cases, and API References sections are almost entirely my own work, although there were at least minor edits on almost every page.

I made this in MS Word.

## [What is context-sensitive help?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOefghJR5o&t=2s)

This is a short video that explains the history and use of context-sensive help.

I made this in Adobe Premiere Rush.

This is an assignement I made for a Udemy class on documenting REST APIs.

I made it in Markdown.
