## [How to create a reusable title sequence in Adobe Premiere Rush](https://richardkf.github.io/techWriting/faulkTitleSequence.pdf)

The genesis of this instructional was a problem I encountered in a tech writing class. We were working with Adobe Premiere Rush, and I wanted to reuse a single title sequence to give my video projects the feel of a documentary series. However, there was no documented function for this, and I couldn't find online cheats either. So I figured it out my own, documented it, and submitted the guide as another assignment.

I made thi in Apple Pages and exported it to PDF.
